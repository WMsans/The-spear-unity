# BetterShaders_AllIn1Sprite Shader

This shader was created using Better Shaders, a Unity asset by Jason Booth that simplifies cross-pipeline shader development.

## Usage
- If you own Better Shaders: You can modify the shader's source code.
- If you don't own Better Shaders: A pre-compiled version matching your current Render Pipeline and Unity version will be automatically set up.

## Why Better Shaders?
Better Shaders was used because Unity doesn't have an easy way to create lit shaders compatible across all render pipelines.

## About Better Shaders
Better Shaders streamlines shader creation by:
- Enabling Unity-like shader writing
- Auto-compiling for various pipelines
- Allowing shader stacking
- Functioning like native Unity shaders
